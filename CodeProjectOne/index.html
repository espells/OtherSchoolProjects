          Our Mission.
        <p class="detailed_paragraphTwo ">
          Patina is a non-profit online platform which facilitates golden agers with programs and activities within their community through a personalized profiling system. Our organization aims to simplify getting active for socially isolated senior citizens by providing them with an up to date activity calendar based on their needs, interests and location. Through Patina we hope to enable older individuals with the knowledge and autonomy to participate in a range of engaging activities all while sparking connections with senior citizens with similar interests.

        How it Works
        <p class="detailed_paragraphTwo">
          Upon signing up with Patina, users undergo a series of questionnaires with the goal of creating a personalized profile. Once the account is activated, participants will be able to find nearby activities based on their interests and location through our easy to use website.
